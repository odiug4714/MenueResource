# MenueResource
Free menu resource interpreter with very fast DMA-SPI display on STM32F103CB microcontroller
This project is designated for programmers witch are familiar with c-language and STM microcontrollers.
In the last years the internet and forums helped me a lot in programming so I decided with this project
to give something back. I hope you enjoy this project. The software is completely free.
I took it together from many free code examples I found  in the internet and arranged them,
including my own modules. I don't give any warranty for correct functioning, the code is as it is.
You are free to change the code if you want. If you have made any extensions, let me know.
I am not responsible for any damage this software could cause.

Idea:
Programmed menues cost lots of memory. Just write a resource string and interprete this resource
string to a menue. With an SD-card you can create thousands of menues in one software.
Even when the resource strings are in flash rom it saves a lot of memory space in comparison
to program every menue by hand. The writing of the menue resources is very easy and saves programming time.
